00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:03,470
Congratulations and thank you for getting
to the end of this short course

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,372
as we conclude the course.

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:07,874
Let's recap the main topics we covered.

4
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:11,778
We went over details of how land works,
including subtleties

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,914
like The Tokenize
and why it can't reverse Lollipop.

6
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,084
We learned methods for evaluating user
inputs

7
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:21,554
to ensure the quality
and safety of the system processing inputs

8
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:25,625
using both chain of thought, reasoning
and splitting tasks into subtasks

9
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,162
with chain prompts and checking outputs
before showing them to users.

10
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:34,034
We also took a look at methods
for evaluating the system over time

11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,870
so as to monitor
and improve its performance.

12
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:40,673
Throughout the course, we also discussed
the importance of building responsibly

13
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,608
with these tools,

14
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,677
ensuring that the model is safe
and provides appropriate responses

15
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,113
that are accurate, relevant
and in the turn you want.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,283
As always, practices key
to mastering these concepts.

17
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:53,086
So we hope you'll apply
what you've learned in your own projects.

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,655
And so that's it.

19
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:59,192
There are so many exciting applications
that are yet to be built.

20
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:03,363
The world needs more people
like you building useful applications,

21
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:07,167
and we look forward to hearing
about the amazing things you build.
